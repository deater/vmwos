Pi-On-Fire Demo v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To try it on your own Pi.

+ You need a Pi with a BCM2835/2708 chip in it
	Pi-1B, Pi-1B+, Pi-1A, maybe a zero

+ Get a version of Raspbian on an SD card

+ Copy /boot/kernel.img (kernel.img on partition /dev/sda1)
	somwhere safe if you ever want Linux again

+ Copy the included kernel.img overtop

+ Put in your pi and boot!  Hopefully it works.

+ If you have a serial port hooked up you can mess with vmwos after
	the demo stops
