.global swi_handler

	@ Wrapper for the SWI handler
	@ You can do this in gcc with __attribute__((interrupt("SWI")))
	@ but it doesn't handle returning the value in r0

	@ TODO: save SPSR, etc?

	@ Note: currently do not call swi from SVC mode or things
	@       will get corrupted


	@ Note, because it's a pain to find, the Linux equivelent is in
	@	entry-armv.S and entry-common.S
