known bugs:
+ something is still off about the chdir code
+ getcwd() is still not implemented
+ kill of process on invalid memory access does something wrong
	probably not restoring stack right
	(this leads to weird behavior on pi1)
+ device_tree code truncates the command line at 255 bytes?

feature requests:
+ fcntl O_NONBLOCK support (for tbo)
+ proper VFS for filesystems
+ mmap() support

For pi2/pi3 support
+ Add mini-uart driver
+ Make the framebuffer use 0x40000000 vs 0xc0000000 appropriately(?)
