Global TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~

Known Kernel Bugs:
	+ pi3: "temp" temperature stops working once virtual memory is enabled
	+ something is still off about the chdir code
	+ pi1: segfault kill on inavlid memory access causes weird behavior
		(probably not restoring stack correctly)
	+ device_tree code truncates the command line at 255 bytes
	+ the occasional "unknown interrupt" (memtest triggers this on pi3)
		The lightning bolt appears, so probably a low-power problem
		(how do we read this source?)

	+ Framebuffer access takes forever, should not do inside of a
		syscall  (should buffer and only send out every 60 Hz or so?)
	+ Interrupts are disabled during a syscall, so we can lose clock
		ticks
	+ user accounting resolution: how does the linux-kernel do this?
		we can't account sub 16ms resolution

Known Userspace Bugs:
	+

Kernel feature requests:
	+ system calls
		- mmap() syscall
		- getcwd() syscall
		- fcntl O_NONBLOCK support (for tbo)
	+ filesystems
		- VFS filesystem abstraction
		- fat filesystem driver
		- ext2 filesystem driver
		- dos33fs
	+ block layer
		- loopback device
		- partition table support
	+ device drivers
		- i2c support
		- sd card support
		- spi support
		- mini-uart driver
		- 1-wire driver
		- USB ( https://github.com/rsta2/uspi )
		- sound
	+ keyboard driver
		- Properly generate ANSI escape chars for arrows, etc
		- Use FIQ interrupt?
	+ framebuffer:
		queue up updates off screen, have kernel thread update
		maybe once a tick (64 fps)

Userspace feature requests:
	+ vlibc
		- scanf()
		- malloc()
		- write() file support

	+ shell
		- command history
		- tab completion
	+ New utilities/programs
		- init (actual, rather than shell)
		- text editor
		- assembler
		- compiler
		- du
		- grep
		- less

Pi Generational Support
	+ Pi2 -- check that it works on both old (armv7) and new (armv8)
	+ Pi2/Pi3 enhanced irqchip support, see:
		[PATCH 4/4] irqchip: Add bcm2836 interrupt controller for Raspberry     Pi 2
	+ Pi3 -- add ARMv8 (arm64) support
	+ Pi3 ACT LED (behind i2c GPIO extender)

Performance:
	+ tophalf/bottomhalf IRQ split
	+ optimized memcpy
	+ optimize graphics routines
